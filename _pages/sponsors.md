### The Digital Greenhouse
The location of the majority of our events, the Digital Greenhouse provides not just a space to meet but also logistical support in organising and promoting events. We are also grateful for the use of their computers and AV equipment without which our events would be very different.

### C5 Alliance
A huge thanks to C5 for sponsoring our National Coding Week Pi Gaming session. The generous donation of Raspberry Piâ€™s and accessories allowed us to offer this experience at zero cost, and also gives us a stock of hardware to call upon for future events.

### States of Guernsey and XMA Ltd
The donation of mice and keyboard  will come in useful as we start to run PC and raspberry PI based gaming session.
