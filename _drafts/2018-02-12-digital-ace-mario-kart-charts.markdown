At first I thought this "Mario Lap Time vs Age" scatter would be the most exciting but in reality it's probably only showing that people who are already good at Mario Kart had a go after a certain age (16 up?).

This is the "Average Mario Kart Lap Time" for each parish. Go Castel!

Interestly, the "Average of Age" shows that Torteval had the youngest players which might explain their performance in the chart above.

This is chart shows the turnout by Parish. As it was hosted in St Peter Port it's no suprise that more people turned up from there.

This shows the average age alongside a hisograph chart.
