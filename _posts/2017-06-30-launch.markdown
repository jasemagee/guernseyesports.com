Following years (well probably months) of idle chatter about how great it would be to play video games on the big screen in the Digital Greenhouse event space, we finally got around to organising something. 

After going back and forth and round and round it was decided that Mario Kart on the Switch and Halo: Combat Evolved on the Xbox were both sufficiently retro and didn't require aging hardware (plus, we really wanted to try Mario Kart on the switch). As this was a Beta event, and because we didnâ€™t want to wait too long for our turn, we decided on minimal advertising and relied on word of mouth.

Over a 2 hour lunch break 11 people came through the door and had waggle which we were very happy with. It was great start and proved not only that this was something that would work, but that there was interest in joining it.
