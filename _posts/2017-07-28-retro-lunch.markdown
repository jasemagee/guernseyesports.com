The second of our Gaming lunches  followed a similar format to the first and saw a similar number of attendees. Again focusing on the Switch and the Xbox one there were opportunities to try a range of games, most of which had a retro feel to them. 

The addition of a second screen and a range of games including Mario Kart Deluxe, Castle Crashers, Speedrunners, and Rez meant that there were lots of opportunities to try something new and get stuck in either competitively or cooperatively.
