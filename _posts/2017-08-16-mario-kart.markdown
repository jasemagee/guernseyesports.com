For our first competitive event we selected the universally loved Mario Kart in it Switch incarnation. Playable by all but with hidden depth and difficulty, its four player split screen Grand Prix mode was a great choice and a great time was had by all. 

Number for this event were kept small by choice allowing us to test the suitability of the space and understand some of the challenges of organising these events. The organising committee plus a few selected friends made up the small 8 man invitational field and fit well with the 4 player races. Unfortunately  Dave Wratten decided that he had better things to do with his evening, earning him a place in the doghouse, and completely messing up any plans we had for the tournament. Thanks Dave.

Even with this hurdle, we had a great tournament with Jason Magee coming out on top and taking home the 8 bit Mario trophy.
